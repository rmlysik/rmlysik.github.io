![Robert Lysik](/images/posts/2012/02/Robert.jpg "Robert Lysik")

I’m a graduate of [Fairfield University](https://www.fairfield.edu/){:target="_blank"} in Fairfield, Connecticut where I received a M.S. in Software Engineering. I’ve been developing software professionally for over 20 years. Currently, I develop software applications for [Cotiviti](https://www.cotiviti.com/){:target="_blank"} in Wilton, Connecticut.

In my spare time I enjoy learning more about web application development and new technologies. At present, I’m trying to expand my knowledge of Angular, .NET Core, AWS and Terraform. You can follow my progress here and on [GitHub](https://github.com/rmlysik){:target="_blank"}.

The photo of me was taken by my son while visiting the [New York Botanical Garden](https://www.nybg.org/){:target="_blank"}. Bonus points if you can name the plant in the background!
